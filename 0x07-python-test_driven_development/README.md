## Project: alx-higher_level_programming - Test Driven Development in Python

This repository contains solutions to various Python programming tasks with a focus on Test Driven Development (TDD). Each task corresponds to a specific Python script and its associated test file.

### Task 0: Integers Addition

**File:** `0-add_integer.py`  
**Test File:** `tests/0-add_integer.txt`

Write a function that adds two integers according to specified conditions. The function prototype, requirements, and usage examples are provided in the task description. The tests are located in the `tests/0-add_integer.txt` file.

### Task 1: Divide a Matrix

**File:** `2-matrix_divided.py`  
**Test File:** `tests/2-matrix_divided.txt`

Implement a function that divides all elements of a matrix. The function prototype, requirements, and usage examples are provided in the task description. The tests are located in the `tests/2-matrix_divided.txt` file.

### Task 2: Say My Name

**File:** `3-say_my_name.py`  
**Test File:** `tests/3-say_my_name.txt`

Write a function that prints a formatted string indicating a person's name. The function prototype, requirements, and usage examples are provided in the task description. The tests are located in the `tests/3-say_my_name.txt` file.

### Task 3: Print Square

**File:** `4-print_square.py`  
**Test File:** `tests/4-print_square.txt`

Implement a function that prints a square of '#' characters. The function prototype, requirements, and usage examples are provided in the task description. The tests are located in the `tests/4-print_square.txt` file.

### Task 4: Text Indentation

**File:** `5-text_indentation.py`  
**Test File:** `tests/5-text_indentation.txt`

Create a function that prints text with specific indentation rules. The function prototype, requirements, and usage examples are provided in the task description. The tests are located in the `tests/5-text_indentation.txt` file.

### Task 5: Max Integer - Unittest

**Files:** `6-max_integer.py` and `tests/6-max_integer_test.py`

Write a function to find the maximum integer in a list. Additionally, create unittests for this function. The function and unittest files are named `6-max_integer.py` and `tests/6-max_integer_test.py`, respectively.

### Task 6: Matrix Multiplication

**File:** `100-matrix_mul.py`  
**Test File:** `tests/100-matrix_mul.txt`

Implement a function that multiplies two matrices. The function prototype, requirements, and usage examples are provided in the task description. The tests are located in the `tests/100-matrix_mul.txt` file.

### Task 7: Lazy Matrix Multiplication

**File:** `101-lazy_matrix_mul.py`  
**Test File:** `tests/101-lazy_matrix_mul.txt`

Write a function that multiplies two matrices using the NumPy module. The function prototype, requirements, and usage examples are provided in the task description. The tests are located in the `tests/101-lazy_matrix_mul.txt` file.

### Task 8: CPython #3: Python Strings

**File:** `102-python.c`  
**Test File:** `102-tests.py`

Create a CPython function that prints information about Python strings. The function prototype and test file are provided in the task description. The shared library is compiled using the provided command.

## How to Run Tests

To run the tests for a specific task, use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m doctest -v path/to/tests/file.txt
```

Replace `path/to/tests/file.txt` with the actual path to the test file you want to execute.

**Note:** Ensure that you have the necessary Python environment set up to run the tests.
